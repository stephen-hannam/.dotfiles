Focus on making it minimal
* no evil, no general, no fancy icons, no fancy theming
* no pdf or image stuff, no terminal emulation from inside emacs

Try to make key-bindings all work the same in -nw mode
* preferably without use of shim packages like "term-lossless"
* also limits theming

Modal editing is still something I want
* no evil, but substitute with something lighter: modalka, boon, xah-fly-keys, ryo, meow?
