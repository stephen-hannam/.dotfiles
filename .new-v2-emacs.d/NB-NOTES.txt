TODO:
1) config tab completions in vertico, esp. for directory paths

Focus on making it minimal
* no evil, no general, no fancy icons, no fancy theming
* no pdf or image stuff, no terminal emulation from inside emacs

Try to make key-bindings all work the same in -nw mode
* preferably without use of shim packages like "term-lossless"
* also limits theming

Modal editing is still something I want
* no evil, but substitute with something lighter: modalka, boon, xah-fly-keys, ryo, meow?

Add VHDL stuff
* especially boiler-plate snippets

Advantages over vim:
* extensible via elisp/racket
* lsp servers and ggtags
* org mode and tables
* magit
* in-built REPL
* the kind of auto-complete and snippets functionality I want

Will still want
- which-key & helpful
- vertico, orderless, marginalia
- undo-tree, git-gutter, spaceline, magit, rainbow-*, hl-todo
- dash, s, hydra, major-mode-hydra
- avy, anzu, multiple-cursors, nerd-commenter (need it be evil-?)

Quick Calc
-> in normal mode, KeyPad digits will open a bottom bar calc
