Existing problems:
- smart-parens is all fucked up
- key-bindings will interfere with terminator key-bindings in -nw mode
- aggressive-indent fucks with the undo --> ditch aggressive for something better
- search highlight/clear not happening across all visible buffers
- tabularize adds extraneous white-space

Switching from/to:
- use-package to straight
- doom-modeline -> telephone-line, or smart-mode-line w powerline theme, or emacs-powerline (https://github.com/jonathanchu/emacs-powerline)
- ivy/counsel/
- aggressive-indent -> ? parinfer, evil-surround
- smart-parens -> ? parinfer, evil-surround, dumbparens :),
- company -> ? corfu, cape, dabbrev-*
- ? dired -> treemacs ??

Removing:
- ivy-rich, ivy-*
- counsel
- veri-kompass

Definitely retaining:
- evil+
- hydras
- org+
- all-the-icons+
- solaire
- beacon
- rainbow+
- which-key
- magit+
- swap regions
- *anzu
- helpful
- "theming"
    Extending and/or Fixing:
    -- dired stuff -> dired-mode invoked hydra for lots of FS shortcuts
    -- undo-tree
    -- command-log-mode
    -- ? smart-parens ... replace or fix ?
    -- dired with dired-sidebar ?

Adding (most likely):
- key-chords: https://github.com/waymondo/use-package-chords
- vertico + marginalia + embark + consult + orderless
- perspective
- ivy-yasnippet
- avy
- info+
- direnv
- treemacs
- expand-region
- ggtags (w uni-ctags)
- git-gutter

Redo:
- take key-bindings from removed functionality and assign it elsewhere
- key-bindings that go unused -> free or redo
- LEADER KEYS - refactor into new categories, new category -> "navigation, windows and such"
    -- 3 leaders: windows & navigation, projects & coding, text manipulation

Consider obseleting:
- general ... can I just use hydra?
- dired ... in favor of treemacs ?

Aims:
- dash-board and org mode (etc) used to habitually organize work/life/study
- common env from within which to view pdfs, images, and other common things
- IDE like env for C/C++, Python, lisps, bash, tcl, verilog/systemverilog
    -- needs to work just as well with remote servers, whether that's TRAMP based, sshfs based, etc.
    -- peek preview of module decl esp. @ ports
- increase text-based efficiency by putting closer at hand short-cuts for complex actions
    -- swapping regions
    -- incr/decr
    -- form/manip table like text-forms
    -- multiple cursors
    -- auto-format and quick completions and snippets
        --- esp. init templates for new files of type
        --- quick format of module decl and inst in verilog
